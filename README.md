Hi! I'm Aiden, (Pew_Lord or LordofVibes on most platforms) i've been coding since March 2020, beginning in python and expanding into Java. I'm 16, 
and plan on making a career out of programming. I have several projects on my page, most notably Money Bot, a discord bot in which I use the hypixel
skyblock public API to sort & find the value and price of almost every item in the game. you can reach me on Discord at Lord#0427.
